Just some simple experiments to get comfortable with ProseMirror(https://prosemirror.net).
`src/index.ts` would be the main thing to look at. The code is somewhat commented.
There are at least comments about each major section.

We implement:

- decorations for styling ranges
- virtualizing a list of node decorations
- simple, in-process sync simulation
