      <h3>Hello ProseMirror</h3>
      <p>
        Use <code>Mod-y</code> to add a highlight <strong>decoration</strong> at
        the selection range. This is very WIP, but you could use decorations
        like this to support all sorts of document annotations (eg, comments).
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the <code>Lorem</code> buttons to insert some sample paragraphs. If
        there is an active selection, the inserted paragraph(s) will replace it.
        Otherwise, the insertion will be appended to the end of the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the <code>Disconnect</code> button to simulate a network partition
        in the sync engine simulator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the <code>Add Editor</code> button at the top of the page to add
        another editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        This demo adds a decoration to every top-level node. Notice the numbers
        at the start of each paragraph. They are managed in a virtualized window
        that should cover the viewport. This is useful for large documents. This
        window updates on every interaction with the editor and on every scroll
        action. If you wish to turn the updates off during scrolling, use the
        corresponding button at the top of the page. Turning off the updates
        during scrolling will allow you to scroll the edge of the virtualized
        decoration window if you use a sufficiently large document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be advised: Chrome has a performance bug in
        <code>contenteditable</code> divs of moderate size. ProseMirror makes
        use <code>contenteditable</code> and experiences the bug, but it is not
        a ProseMirror-specific issue. For better performance on large documents,
        use Safari or Firefox. Use the <code>Lorem 10000</code> button to get a
        document of moderate size.
